This package is still in WIP üõ†Ô∏è stages, so the interface may be subject to change. With that said, the package currently supports:

- üöÄ __NEW!__ Support for many APIs:
    - OpenAI
    - OpenAI compliant, with a custom URL
    - Anthropic
    - OpenRouter, with support for hundreds of models, and many OpenRouter exclusive features.
- Creating and parsing ChatML style requests and responses.
- Creating and parsing raw prompt style requests and responses.
- Formatting prompt strings with `[INST]`, `<<SYS>>`, and `<s>` tags for models with llama style fine-tuning.
- Most common LLM parameters such as `temperature`, `topP`, `topK`, `repetitionPenalty`, etc.
- OpenRouter specific features like fallback models and provider preferences.
- LLM tool use - this enables the AI model to call Roc functions and use the results in its answers.
  - Includes a collection of prebuilt tools, or you can build your own
- Prompt caching on supported models

## Known issues:
- Tool use is currently not supported with the anthropic API, 
    - this is due to missing support in Roc for decoding json dictionaries [roc#5294](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/5294)
    - __Workaround:__ Anthropic models can be accessed through OpenRouter, with full tool calling support
- Prompt caching has currently only be been tested through OpenRouter


## Example
```roc
main! = |_|
    api_key = Env.var!("OPENAI_API_KEY")?
    query = "How are you today?"
    client = Chat.new_client({ api: OpenAI, api_key, model: "gpt-4o-mini" })
        |> Chat.append_user_message(query, {})
    response = Http.send!(Chat.build_http_request(client, {}))?
    messages = Chat.update_message_list(client, response)? |> .messages
    when messages is
        [.., message] -> Stdout.line!(message.content)
        _ -> Ok({})
```
